DISTANCE CONVERTER 

The problem
Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in meters. The program will then present the following menu of selections:

Convert to kilometers
Convert to inches
Convert to feet
Quit the program
The program will convert the distance to kilometers, inches, or feet, depending on the userâ€™s selection. Here are the specific requirements:

Write a method named calculateKilometers, which accepts the number of meters as an argument. The method should return the argument converted to kilometers. Convert the meters to kilometers using the following formula: kilometers = meters * 0.001
Write a method named calculateInches, which accepts the number of meters as an argument. The method should retrun the argument converted to inches, Convert the meters to inches using the following formula: inches = meters * 39.37
Write a method named calculateFeet, which accepts the number of meters as an argument. The method should return the argument converted to feet. Convert the meters to feet using the following formula:feet = meters * 3.281
Write a method named menu that returns a list of menu of selections. This method should not accept any arguments.
The program should continue to display the menu until the user enters 4 to quit the program.
If the user selects an invalid choice from the menu, the program should display an error message.

Breaking it down
Create calculateKilometers method

/**
 * The calculateKilometers method displays the kilometers that are equivalent to
 * a specified number of meters.
 *
 * @param meters
 * @return the number of kilometers
 */
static double calculateKilometers(double meters) {

    double kilometers = meters * 0.001;

    return kilometers;
}

Create calculateInches method
/**
 * This method should calculate inches that are equivalent to a specified
 * number of meters.
 *
 * @param meters
 * @return the number of inches
 */
static double calculateInches(double meters) {

    double inches = meters * 39.37;

    return inches;
}



Create calculateFeet method
/**
 * This method should calculate the feet that are equivalent to a specified
 * number of meters.
 *
 * @param meters
 * @return The number of feet.
 */
static double calculateFeet(double meters) {

    double feet = meters * 3.281;

    return feet;
}
Create a method that returns a menu item list
/**
 * This method should return a collection of menu items.
 *
 * @return
 */
static List<String> getMenu() {

    List<String> menuItems = new ArrayList<String>();
    menuItems.add("Convert to kilometers");
    menuItems.add("Convert to inches");
    menuItems.add("Convert to feet");
    menuItems.add("Quit the program");

    return menuItems;
}
Create variables, scanner for keyboard input
int selection; // Menu selection
double distance; // Distance in meters

// Create a Scanner object for keyboard input.
Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
Ask user for input, calculate selection
// Get a distance.
System.out.print("Enter a distance in meters: ");
distance = keyboard.nextDouble();

// Display the menu and process the user's
// selection until 4 is selected.
List<String> menuItems = getMenu();
do {

    // Display the menu.
    for (int x = 0; x < menuItems.size(); x++) {
        System.out.println((x + 1) + ". " + menuItems.get(x));
    }

    // Get the user's selection.
    System.out.print("\nEnter your choice: ");
    selection = keyboard.nextInt();

    // Validate the user's selection.
    while (selection < 1 || selection > 4) {
        System.out.print("Invalid selection. Enter your choice: ");
        selection = keyboard.nextInt();
    }

    // Process the user's selection.
    switch (selection) {
        case 1:
           System.out.println(distance + " meters is " +
                   calculateKilometers(distance) + " kilometers.");
            break;
        case 2:
           System.out.println(distance + " meters is " +
                   calculateInches(distance) + " inches.");
            break;
        case 3:
           System.out.println(distance + " meters is " +
                   calculateFeet(distance) + " feet.");
            break;
        case 4:
            System.out.println("Bye!");
    }

    System.out.println();

} while (selection != 4);
