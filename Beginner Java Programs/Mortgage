MORTGAGE

The problem
Write a program that computes loan payments. The loan can be a car loan, a student loan, or a home mortgage loan. The program lets the user enter the interest rate, number of years, loan amount, and displays the monthly and total payments.

Breaking it down
public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);

    // ask user for input
    System.out.println("This program computes monthly loan payments.");
    System.out.print("Enter loan amount: ");
    double loanAmount = console.nextDouble();

    System.out.print("Enter number of years: ");
    int years = console.nextInt();

    System.out.print("Enter interest rate: ");
    double interestRate = console.nextDouble();
    System.out.println();

    //close stream
    console.close();

    // call method for payment
    double payment = calculateMonthlyPayment(loanAmount, years, interestRate);

    // output result
    System.out.println("Your loan payment = $" + (int) payment);
}

/**
 * Method should calculate monthly payment
 *
 * @param loanAmount
 * @param years
 * @param interestRate
 * @return payment
 */
static double calculateMonthlyPayment(double loanAmount, int years,
        double interestRate) {

    int months = 12 * years;
    double c = interestRate / 12.0 / 100.0;
    double payment = loanAmount * c * Math.pow(1 + c, months)
            / (Math.pow(1 + c, months) - 1);

    return payment;
}
Output
This program computes monthly loan payments.
Enter loan amount: 10000
Enter number of years: 10
Enter interest rate: 10

Your loan payment = $132
Unit tests
@Test
public void validatePayment() {

    double val = Mortgage.calculateMonthlyPayment(10000, 10, 10);

    assertEquals(132.15073688176193, val, 0);
