Test Average

The problem
Write a program that asks the user to enter in test scores. The program should display each test score as well as the average

Breaking it down
Create a data structure that will hold test scores
List<Double> scores = new ArrayList<Double>();
Write a method that will average the values
/**
 * Method should return the average score
 *
 * @param scores
 * @return double
 */
static double averageScore(List<Double> scores) {
    double sum = 0;
    if (!scores.isEmpty()) {
        for (Double score : scores) {
            sum += score;
        }
        return sum / scores.size();
    }
    return sum;
}
Ask user to input test scores
Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.print("Enter test score (-1 to exit): ");
double selection = keyboard.nextDouble();

while (selection != -1) {
    System.out.print("Enter test score (-1 to exit): ");
    selection = keyboard.nextDouble();
    if (selection != -1) {
        scores.add(selection);
    }
}
Output test scores and average
System.out.println("The scores entered: " + scores);

System.out.print("The average: " + averageScore(scores));
Output
Enter test score (-1 to exit): 55
Enter test score (-1 to exit): 78
Enter test score (-1 to exit): 99
Enter test score (-1 to exit): 87
Enter test score (-1 to exit): 96
Enter test score (-1 to exit): 76
Enter test score (-1 to exit): -1
The scores entered: [78.0, 99.0, 87.0, 96.0, 76.0]
The average: 87.2
