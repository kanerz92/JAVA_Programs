Parking ticket simulator program

he problem
For this assignment you will design a set of classes that work together to simulate a police officer issuing a parking ticket. You should design the following classes:

The ParkedCar Class: This class should simulate a parked car. The class's responsibilities are as follows:

To know the car's make, model, color, license number, and the number of minutes that the car has been parked.
The ParkingMeter Class: This class should simulate a parking meter. The class's only responsibility is as follows:

To know the number of minutes of parking time that has been purchased.
The PoliceOfficer Class: This class should simulate a police officer inspecting parked cars. The class's responsibilities are as follows:

To know the police officer's name and badge number
To examine a ParkedCar object and a ParkingMeter object, and determine whether the car's time has expired
To issue a parking ticket (generate a ParkingTicket object) if the car's time has expired
The ParkingTicket Class: This class should simulate a parking ticket. The class's responsibilities are as follows:

To report the make, model, color, and license number of the illegally parked car
To report the amount of the fine, which is $25 for the first hour or part of an hour that the car is illegally parked, plus $10 for every additional hour or part hour that the car is illegally parked, plus $l0 for every additional hour or part of an hour that the car is illegally parked
To report the name and badge number of the police officer issuing the ticket
Write a program that demonstrates how these classes collaborate.
