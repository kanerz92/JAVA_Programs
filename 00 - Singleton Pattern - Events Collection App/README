The main method class for the program is in Application class, located in the eventMain package.
Import classes to run main().

										Within eventMain package
Application Class:
	-Use of Jackson Object mapper to read JSON file and to deserialise into an instance of EventsCollection
	-Method to get user input, split into getting events based on specific year or range of years
	-EventsCollection checked based on year and outputted to console
	-getInputRange method calls EventTimeline class and creates instance, puts into arraylist which then implements sort method
	-Sorted EventTimeline instance is then printed for a sorted range of events to be displayed to user

EventsCollection Class:
	-Class to hold Set of Events being imported by Jackson from JSON file
	-Implementing singleton class of EventsCollection with getInstance method
	-Only one instance of EventsCollection ever created 
	-Adding the deserialised JSON file from mapper object into the EventCollection singleton tree set
	
										Within eventClasses package
EventSuper:
	-Adding to make an open/closed system
	-Super class for events implementing comparable interface of type events, used to implement sorting by year with compareTo
	

Events Class:
	-Class for main events
	-Instantiated TreeSet of subevents
	-Throw exception within setSubevents to only allow sub events to be added if they occur on or after main event year
	

SubEvents Class:
	-Extends Events Class
	-Overrided toString

EventTimeline Class:
	-Class to store user range of events needed and to implement a sorting method
	-Implementing a singleton class of EventTimeline for when user inputs a range of events to be checked and to output sorted ET
	-Sort method, sorting arraylist in ascending order by the implemented comparable interface and compare to, sorting by year
